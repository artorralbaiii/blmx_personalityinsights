Dear google boss

My name is Chloe and when I am bigger I would like a job with google.
I also want to work in a chocolate factory and do swimming in the olympics.
I go swimming on Saturday and Tuesday.
My dad said I can sit on bean bags and go down slides and ride go karts in a job in google.
I like computers too and have a tablet I play games on.
My dad gave me a game where I have to move a robot up and down squares, he said it will be good for me to learn about computers.
My dad said he will egt me a computer one day.
I am seven years old and my teachers tell my mum and dad I am very good in class and am good at my spelling and reasing and my sums.
My dad told me if I carry on being good and learning one day I will be able to have a job at Google.
My sister Hollie is also very clever but she likes dolls and dressing up, she is five.
My dad told me to give you a application to get a job in Google.
I don;t really know what one of them is but he said a letter will do for now.
Thank you for reading my letter I have only ever sent one other and that was to Father Christmas.

Good bye.
